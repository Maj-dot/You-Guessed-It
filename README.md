# Just Guess It! ðŸš€

## Overview

**Just Guess It!** is a fun, browser-based word guessing game where the objective is to help "Nola," a space-woman, get back to her spaceship by correctly guessing different sneaker brands. Each correct guess reveals part of the word, and each incorrect guess brings Nola closer to being stuck on Earth forever!

The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or make six incorrect guesses. After each successful guess, you level up and the game continues with a new word. If you guess the final word correctly, Nola finally gets to phone home!

- **Scoring**: Tracks your score as you correctly guess words.
